Deepfakes are AI-generated synthetic media in which a person’s likeness is replaced with someone else’s, making it difficult to distinguish between real and fake videos. With the rapid advancement of deep learning, deepfakes have become more realistic — posing serious challenges to security, privacy, and digital trust.

This project, “Deepfake Detection using Deep Learning (XceptionNet + Frequency Domain Analysis + Feature Fusion)”, aims to accurately identify fake images by combining spatial and frequency domain features. The model integrates XceptionNet (for image feature extraction) with Frequency Domain Analysis (FDA) and a Feature Fusion mechanism to enhance classification performance.

The system processes images to detect faces, extracts frames, and analyzes both visual and frequency cues to classify each video as Real or Fake. The approach leverages deep learning’s power for robust detection, even under heavy compression or visual manipulation.
